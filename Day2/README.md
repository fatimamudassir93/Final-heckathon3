### **🔹 Key Achievements of Day 2:**  

## **1️⃣ Defining Technical Requirements 🛠️**  
The foundation of any great product lies in a well-defined technical structure. Today, I outlined:  

🔹 **Frontend Requirements:**  
- Built with **Next.js** for a seamless and fast UI experience.  
- A fully **responsive design** to ensure compatibility across devices.  
- Core pages like **Homepage, Product Listing, Product Details, Cart, Checkout, and Order Confirmation.**  

🔹 **Backend & Database (Sanity CMS):**  
- **Sanity CMS** serves as the **backend database**, handling **product data, customer information, and orders** efficiently.  
- Defined **schemas** in Sanity to align with the business goals.  
- Structured content management for easy updates and dynamic product handling.  

🔹 **Third-Party API Integrations:**  
- **Payment Gateway Integration (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)** for smooth transaction processing.  
- **Shipment Tracking API** to provide real-time order tracking for customers.

## **2️⃣ Designing the System Architecture 🔍**  
A well-planned **system architecture** is the backbone of any application. Here’s how the components interact:  

📌 **Frontend (Next.js)** – User-facing application handling product browsing, cart management, and checkout.  
📌 **Sanity CMS** – Serves as the **database** for product and order management.  
📌 **Third-Party APIs** – Handles external services like **shipment tracking and payments**.  
📌 **Data Flow:**  
1️⃣ User browses the marketplace on **Next.js frontend**.  
2️⃣ The frontend fetches product data from **Sanity CMS** via API requests.  
3️⃣ When an order is placed, the details are stored in **Sanity CMS**.  
4️⃣ **Shipment tracking API** fetches real-time order status updates.  
5️⃣ **Payment gateway API** processes secure transactions.  
6️⃣ The system updates and syncs data between **frontend, backend, and external APIs**.  

A strong architecture ensures **scalability, efficiency, and seamless user experience!** 🔥

## **3️⃣ Planning API Requirements 🌐**  
A well-structured API is critical for smooth communication between different components. I outlined key RESTful APIs:  

📌 **GET /products** → Fetch all available products from **Sanity CMS**.  
📌 **POST /orders** → Create a new order with customer details, product data, and payment status.  
📌 **GET /shipment** → Retrieve order tracking details from the **shipment tracking API**.  

Each API is designed to optimize **performance, data accuracy, and security**, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.

## **4️⃣ Designing Key Workflows 🔄**  
To ensure smooth platform operations, I planned critical workflows:  

✅ **User Registration:** User signs up → Data is stored in **Sanity CMS** → Confirmation email sent.  
✅ **Product Browsing:** User views products → Sanity API fetches data → Products displayed dynamically.  
✅ **Order Placement:** User adds items to cart → Proceeds to checkout → Order details stored in **Sanity CMS**.  
✅ **Shipment Tracking:** Order status updates fetched from **third-party API** → Displayed to the user.  

Each step is carefully planned to **enhance user experience and system efficiency!** 💡

### **📍 Key Takeaways from Today:**  
✅ Clear understanding of **how frontend, backend, and APIs communicate**.  
✅ Well-defined **system architecture** to ensure smooth data flow.  
✅ Properly planned **API structure and key workflows**.  
✅ The importance of **scalability, security, and efficiency** in technical planning.
