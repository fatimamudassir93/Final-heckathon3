ðŸŽ‰ Hackathon Day 1: Laying the Foundation for Your Marketplace Journey

Iâ€™m excited to share that I successfully completed Day 1 of the 3rd Hackathon Titled Laying the Foundation for Your Marketplace Journey.

For this challenge, I selected the General E-commerce option and focused on creating a furniture marketplace. My approach involved:

Defining the primary purpose of the marketplace.
Clearly outlining the business goals based on the provided requirements.
Designing and presenting a detailed schema to map out the marketplaceâ€™s structure and functionality.
This experience was a fantastic opportunity to showcase my skills in planning and structuring an online platform while ensuring that the goals align with a scalable and user-friendly design.

Completing this task successfully has boosted my confidence, and Iâ€™m eager to tackle the upcoming challenges in this hackathon!

The journey has just begun, and Iâ€™m excited to see where it takes me. ðŸš€
