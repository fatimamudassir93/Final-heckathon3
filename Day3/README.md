ðŸš€ Hackathon Day 3: API Integration & Data Migration


Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve successfully completed Day 3 of the Hackathon, where my primary focus was on API Integration and Data Migration into Sanity CMS for building a fully functional backend for my furniture eCommerce project. This was a pivotal step in creating a dynamic, scalable platform capable of handling real-time data from external sources.
Key Learning Outcomes: API Integration in Next.js: I learned how to integrate various APIs into a Next.js project, which is crucial for fetching live data such as product listings, categories, and order history. By connecting the backend with external APIs, the platform can dynamically display real-time information to users. It was an essential step towards creating a modern, headless eCommerce architecture.

Data Migration to Sanity CMS:
 One of the major tasks was to migrate existing data into Sanity CMS. This involved carefully adjusting my Sanity schema to ensure it aligned perfectly with the API data. For example, I mapped fields such as product_title in the API to the name field in my Sanity schema. Ensuring data consistency and integrity during this process was critical for seamless integration.

Schema Validation and Adjustment:
 After reviewing the API documentation, I spent time comparing the schema from Sanity CMS to the incoming data structure. This process involved updating field types, names, and relationships to ensure compatibility, which allowed for smooth migration of the data. 


Exploring Different Migration Methods: I explored several methods for migrating data:

Using Provided APIs:
 I wrote scripts to fetch and transform data from external APIs. Manual Import: For smaller datasets, I experimented with exporting data as JSON/CSV and uploading it to Sanity manually.



 Error Handling & Testing:
 Ensuring robust error handling is a crucial part of any API integration. I implemented error logging and fallback mechanisms to ensure the frontend could still function even if some data failed to load. Testing was carried out using Postman and browser developer tools to ensure that the API calls were consistent and error-free.
