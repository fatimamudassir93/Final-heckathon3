Day 5 – Testing, Error Handling, and Backend Refinement – Hackathon Update 🚀

Today marks Day 5 of my hackathon, where I focused on testing, error handling, and refining backend integrations for my marketplace project. Here’s a quick summary of the progress:

1. Functional Testing ✅
Validated key features like product listings, cart functionality, and dynamic routing to ensure they work smoothly.
Conducted tests using Postman for APIs and Cypress for end-to-end testing.
2. Error Handling ⚠️
Implemented user-friendly error messages for failed API calls and network issues.
Ensured smooth fallback UI for scenarios like missing product data.
3. Performance Optimization ⚡
Optimized images and reduced page load time using Lighthouse and GTmetrix.
Focused on improving lazy loading and asset compression to enhance performance.
4. Security Measures 🔒
Added input validation and ensured HTTPS communication for secure interactions.
Conducted vulnerability scans using OWASP ZAP for security assurance.
5. Cross-Browser and Device Testing 🌐
Tested across different browsers and devices to ensure the platform is fully responsive.
6. CSV Testing Report 📊
Along with the manual testing, I also prepared a CSV-based testing report.
The report includes Test Cases, Expected Results, Actual Results, Status, and Severity Levels for each feature tested. This ensures proper tracking and documentation of all testing efforts, making it easy for the team to review and fix any issues.
